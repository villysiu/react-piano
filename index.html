This is a Single Page Application (SPA). The frontend is built with react-redux. The frontend will communicate with a backend API built with Ruby and Rails.
This project allows user to create, edit and delete simple music sheets, and store the music sheets in the backend api.

It used redux-thunk middleware to communicate with the backend api and change state.

The communication with api is in musicAction. If there is any error, it will be catched by <code>Promise.reject(response)</code>, the error message willbe sent to reducer and displayed accordingly.

This project has two reducers, musicReducer and pianoReducer, to return new state values.
musicReducer - change state after result returned from backend. 
piano - change state after piano key is pressed.

This piano project only supports these notes: C3, D3, E3, F3, G3, A3, B3, C4, and 4 lines max. Space between each note and comma for new line.
It must be in this format: 
<code>
  C3 C3 G3 G3 A3 A3 G3, F3 F3 E3 E3 D3 D3 C3, G3 G3 F3 F3 E3 E3 D3, G3 G3 F3 F3 E3 E3 D3, C3 C3 G3 G3 A3 A3 G3, F3 F3 E3 E3 D3 D3 C3
</code>
